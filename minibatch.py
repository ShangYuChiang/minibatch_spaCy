Hydrocarbons (HCs) present on the epicuticle of terrestrial insects are not only used to reduce water loss but are also used as chemical signals. The cytochrome p450 CYP4G gene is essential for HC biosynthesis in some insects. However, its function in Tenebrio molitor is unknown. Moreover, it is not yet known whether CYP4G of a host can modulate the searching behaviours of its parasitoid. Here, we explore the function of the TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 genes in T. molitor. The TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 transcripts could be detected in all developmental stages. Their expression was higher in the fat body and abdominal cuticle than in the gut. Their transcript levels in mature larvae under desiccation stress [relative humidity (RH) < 5%] was significantly higher than that in the control (RH = 70%). Injection of dsCYP4G122 and dsCYP4G123 caused a reduction in HC biosynthesis and was associated with increased susceptibility to desiccation. Individuals of the parasitoid Scleroderma guani that emerged from mealworm pupae showed host preference for normal pupae whereas S. guani that emerged from pupae lacking CYP4G122 or/and CYP4G123 lost this searching preference. The current results confirm that CYP4G122 and CYP4G123 regulate the biosynthesis of HCs and modulate the olfactory response of its parasitoid S. guani.',{'entities': [(26,36,'Gene'),(41,51,'Gene'),(55,71,'Species'),(122,139,'Species'),(307,312,'Gene'),(393,409,'Species'),(460,465,'Gene'),(570,580,'Gene'),(585,593,'Gene'),(603,613,'Species'),(619,629,'Gene'),(634,642,'Gene'),(1115,1132,'Species'),(1214,1222,'Species'),(1255,1263,'Gene'),(1271,1279,'Gene'),(1345,1353,'Gene'),(1358,1366,'Gene'),(1454,1462,'Species')]}),('Chitin deacetylase 1 and 2 are indispensable for larval-pupal and pupal-adult molts in Heortia vitessoides (Lepidoptera: Crambidae).

Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) catalyze the N-deacetylation of chitin, which is a crucial process for chitin modification. Here, we identified and characterized HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 from H. vitessoides. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 possess typical domain structures of CDAs and belong to the Group I CDAs. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 were highly expressed before and after the larval-larval molt. In addition, both exhibited relatively high mRNA expression levels during the larval-pupal molt, the pupal stage, and the pupal-adult molt. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were highest in the body wall and relatively high in the larval head. Significant increases in the HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were observed in the larvae upon exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone. RNA interference-mediated HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 silencing significantly inhibited HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 expression, with abnormal or nonviable phenotypes being observed. Post injection survival rates of the larvae injected with dsHvCDA1 and dsHvCDA2 were 66.7% and 46.7% (larval-pupal) during development and 23.0% and 6.7% (pupal-adult), respectively.

This suggests that Bm-hb suppresses segmentation. The results obtained also suggest that the gap gene Bm-Kr (Bombyx Kruppel) provides a permissive environment for the progression of segmentation by suppressing the expression Bm-hb, which terminates segmentation. This indicates a novel mechanism by which the gap gene is involved in segmentation. It appears that Bm-Kr and Bm-hb are involved in segment counting and their interplay contributes to the correct number of segments being formed in Bombyx.

Copidosoma floridanum is a polyembryonic, caste-forming, wasp species. The ratio of investment in different castes changes with environmental stressors (e.g. multi-parasitism with competitors). The vasa gene was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster as a germ-cell-determining factor, and C. floridanum vasa (Cf-vas) gene positive cells have been known to develop into reproductive larvae. Cf-vas seems to control the ratio of investment in C. floridanum larval castes. In this study, we identified environmental factors that control Cf-vas mRNA expression in Japanese C. floridanum by examining Cf-vas mRNA expression under competitor (Meteorus pulchricornis) venom stress; we treated the male and female morulae with M. pulchricornis venom. We also assessed the effects of multi-parasitism of Japanese C. floridanum with M. pulchricornis and found an increasing number of female soldier larvae. The results showed that several amino acid sequences differ between the Japanese and US Cf-vas. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that Japanese Cf-vas mRNA is expressed in both male and female larvae and pupae, but mRNA expression decreases in adults. Cf-vas mRNA expression significantly decreased, while C. floridanum dronc (Cf-dronc) mRNA expression increased, in female morulae after M. pulchricornis venom treatment at 20  h and 0  h of the culture period, respectively. Females and males showed different Cf-vas or Cf-dronc mRNA expression after M. pulchricornis venom treatment.

AIMS: Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a vital role in mRNA trafficking and translation inhibition to regulate the synthesis of local proteins in neuronal axons and dendritic terminals. However, there are no reports on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of FMRP levels in Drosophila. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs regulating FMRP levels in Drosophila. MAIN METHODS: Using online software, we predicted and selected 11 miRNAs potentially acting on the Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dFMR1) transcript. These candidates were screened for modulation of dFMR1 transcript levels at the cellular level using a dual luciferase reporter system. In addition, we constructed a transgenic Drosophila model overexpressing miR-219 in the nervous system and quantified dFMRP by western blotting. The neuromuscular junction phenotype in the model was studied by immunofluorescence staining. KEY FINDINGS: Among the 11 miRNAs screened, miR-219 and miR-960 reduced luciferase gene activity by binding to the 3 -UTR of the dFMR1 transcript. Mutation of the miR-219 or miR-960 binding sites on the transcript resulted in complete or partial elimination of the miRNA-induced repression. Western blots revealed that dFMRP expression was decreased in the miR-219 overexpression model (Elav>miR-219). Drosophila larvae overexpressing miR-219 showed morphological abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (increased synaptic boutons and synaptic branches). This finding is consistent with some phenotypes observed in dfmr1 mutants. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that miR-219 regulates dFMR1 expression in Drosophila and is involved in fragile X syndrome pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings expand the current understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of target molecule-related functions.',{'entities': [(0,7,'Gene'),(32,37,'Gene'),(41,64,'Species'),(72,108,'Gene'),(110,114,'Gene'),(342,346,'Gene'),(357,367,'Species'),(414,418,'Gene'),(429,439,'Species'),(540,550,'Species'),(551,581,'Gene'),(583,588,'Gene'),(651,656,'Gene'),(779,789,'Species'),(811,818,'Gene'),(856,861,'Gene'),(1021,1028,'Gene'),(1033,1040,'Gene'),(1106,1111,'Gene'),(1140,1147,'Gene'),(1151,1158,'Gene'),(1296,1301,'Gene'),(1334,1341,'Gene'),(1369,1376,'Gene'),(1412,1419,'Gene'),(1597,1602,'Gene'),(1651,1658,'Gene'),(1669,1674,'Gene'),(1689,1699,'Species')]}),('WSV181 inhibits JAK/STAT signaling and promotes viral replication in Drosophila.

WSV181 overexpression in transgenic flies resulted in the downregulation of STAT92E and STAT92E-targeted genes.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) is an indispensable survival gene in holometabolous insects, playing key roles in cuticle tanning and immunity. In this study, we investigated whether Th could be used as a potential target in controlling N. lugens. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that NlTh had a periodical expression pattern during molting with the highest level observed in epidermis. Dysfunction of NlTH by dsNlTh microinjection or 3-IT feeding similarly caused rapid death of N. lugens. Compared with dsGFP control BPHs, dsNlTh injected BPHs (i) had cuticle pigmentation and sclerotizaton defects; (ii) had less endocuticle lamella in tergum integument; (iii) showed higher mortality during the molting process as a result of defective cuticle shedding; (iv) showed feeding disorders indicated by a low number of probe wound dots on rice; (v) had more vulnerable cuticle.

Background: Molting is a crucial physiological behavior during arthropod growth. In the past few years, molting as well as chitin biosynthesis triggered by molting, is subject to regulation by miRNAs. However, how many miRNAs are involved in insect molting at the genome-wide level remains unknown. Results: We deeply sequenced four samples obtained from nymphs at the 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th instars, and then identified 61 miRNAs conserved in the Arthropoda and 326 putative novel miRNAs in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a fearful pest of rice. A total of 36 mature miRNAs with significant different expression levels at the genome scale during molting, including 19 conserved and 17 putative novel miRNAs were identified. After comparing the expression profiles, we found that most of the targets of 36 miRNAs showing significantly differential expression were involved in energy and hormone pathways. One of the 17 putative novel miRNAs, nlu-miR-173 was chosen for functional study. nlu-miR-173 acts in 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling through its direct target, N. lugens Ftz-F1(NlFtz-F1), a transcription factor. Furthermore, we found that the transcription of nlu-miR-173 was promoted by Broad-Complex (BR-C), suggesting that its involvement in the 20-hydroxyecdysone pathway contributes to proper molting function.

NlChP was highly expressed in the follicular cells of female adult brown planthoppers. Knockdown of NlChP resulted in oocyte malformation and the inability to perform oviposition, and electron microscopy showed that the malformed oocytes had thin and rough endochorion layers compared to the control group. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the eggshell components revealed four unique peptides that were matched to NlChP.

The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens is one of the most destructive insect pests in the rice fields of Asia. Like other hemipteran insects, BPH is not susceptible to Cry toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or transgenic rice carrying Bt cry genes. Lack of Cry receptors in the midgut is one of the main reasons that BPH is not susceptible to the Cry toxins. The main Cry-binding proteins (CBPs) of the susceptible insects are cadherin, aminopeptidase N (APN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In this study, we analyzed and validated de novo assembled transcripts from transcriptome sequencing data of BPH to identify and characterize homologs of cadherin, APN, and ALP. We then compared the cadherin-, APN-, and ALP-like proteins of BPH to previously reported CBPs to identify their homologs in BPH. The sequence analysis revealed that at least one cadherin, one APN, and two ALPs of BPH contained homologous functional domains identified from the Cry-binding cadherin, APN, and ALP, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction used to verify the expression level of each putative Cry receptor homolog in the BPH midgut indicated that the CBPs homologous APN and ALP were expressed at high or medium-high levels while the cadherin was expressed at a low level. These results suggest that homologs of CBPs exist in the midgut of BPH. However, differences in key motifs of CBPs, which are functional in interacting with Cry toxins, may be responsible for insusceptibility of BPH to Cry toxins.',{'entities': [(24,58,'Gene'),(83,85,'Species'),(94,112,'Species'),(150,167,'Species'),(169,172,'Species'),(174,192,'Species'),(244,248,'Species'),(296,299,'Species'),(336,358,'Species'),(360,362,'Species'),(378,382,'Species'),(392,394,'Species'),(414,427,'Gene'),(474,477,'Species'),(525,545,'Gene'),(547,551,'Gene'),(584,592,'Gene'),(594,610,'Gene'),(612,615,'Gene'),(622,642,'Gene'),(644,647,'Gene'),(759,762,'Species'),(804,812,'Gene'),(814,817,'Gene'),(823,826,'Gene'),(849,857,'Gene'),(860,863,'Gene'),(870,873,'Gene'),(891,894,'Species'),(918,922,'Gene'),(953,956,'Species'),(1007,1015,'Gene'),(1021,1024,'Gene'),(1034,1038,'Gene'),(1042,1045,'Species'),(1118,1126,'Gene'),(1128,1131,'Gene'),(1137,1140,'Gene'),(1286,1289,'Species'),(1316,1320,'Gene'),(1332,1335,'Gene'),(1340,1343,'Gene'),(1399,1407,'Gene'),(1477,1481,'Gene'),(1505,1508,'Species'),(1548,1552,'Gene'),(1650,1653,'Species')]}),('Double-stranded RNA targeting calmodulin reveals a potential target for pest management of Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: Calmodulin (CaM) is an essential protein in cellular activity and plays important roles in many processes in insect development. RNA interference (RNAi) has been hypothesized to be a promising method for pest control. CaM is a good candidate for RNAi target. However, the sequence and function of CaM in Nilaparvata lugens are unknown. Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) target to CaM gene in pest control is still unavailable. RESULTS: In the present study, two alternatively spliced variants of CaM transcripts, designated NlCaM1 and NlCaM2, were cloned from N. lugens. The two cDNA sequences exhibited 100% identity to each other in the open reading frame (ORF), and only differed in the 3  untranslated region (UTR). NlCaM including NlCaM1 and NlCaM2 mRNA was detectable in all developmental stages and tissues of N. lugens, with significantly increased expression in the salivary glands. Knockdown of NlCaM expression by RNAi with different dsRNAs led to an inability to molt properly, increased mortality, which ranged from 49.7 to 92.5%, impacted development of the ovaries and led to female infertility. There were no significant reductions in the transcript levels of vitellogenin and its receptor or in the total vitellogenin protein level relative to the control group. However, a significant reduction in vitellogenin protein was detected in ovaries injected with dsNlCaM. In addition, a specific dsRNA of NlCaM for control of N. lugens was designed and tested. CONCLUSION: NlCaM plays important roles mainly in nymph development and uptake of vitellogenin by ovaries in vitellogenesis in N. lugens. dsRNA derived from the less conserved 3 -UTR of NlCaM shows great potential for RNAi-based N. lugens management.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry.',{'entities': [(30,40,'Gene'),(91,109,'Species'),(123,133,'Gene'),(135,138,'Gene'),(341,344,'Gene'),(420,423,'Gene'),(427,445,'Species'),(514,517,'Gene'),(630,633,'Gene'),(658,664,'Gene'),(669,675,'Gene'),(694,703,'Species'),(854,859,'Gene'),(870,876,'Gene'),(881,887,'Gene'),(951,960,'Species'),(1039,1044,'Gene'),(1551,1556,'Gene'),(1572,1581,'Species'),(1619,1624,'Gene'),(1734,1743,'Species'),(1793,1798,'Gene'),(1836,1845,'Species')]}),('Characterization of NlHox3, an essential gene for embryonic development in Nilaparvata lugens.

Ethiprole selection of two field N. lugens populations resulted in strong resistance to both ethiprole and fipronil and resulted in fixation of the A301S mutation, as well as the emergence of another mutation, Q359E in one of the selected strains. To analyse the roles of these mutations in resistance to phenylpyrazoles, three Rdl constructs: wild type, A301S and A301S+Q359E were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assessed for their sensitivity to ethiprole and fipronil using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Neither of the mutant Rdl subtypes significantly reduced the antagonistic action of fipronil, however there was a significant reduction in response to ethiprole in the two mutated subtypes compared with the wild type. Bioassays with a Drosophila melanogaster strain carrying the A301S mutation showed strong resistance to ethiprole but not fipronil compared to a strain without this mutation, thus further supporting a causal role for the A301S mutation in resistance to ethiprole.

However, a comparison between miRNA and siRNA in pest control is still unavailable, particularly in targeting chitin synthase gene A (CHSA). RESULTS: The dsRNA for Nilaparvata lugens CHSA (dsNlCHSA) and the microR-2703 (miR-2703) mimic targeting NlCHSA delivered via feeding affected the development of nymphs, reduced their chitin content and led to lethal phenotypes. The protein level of NlCHSA was downregulated after female adults were injected with dsNlCHSA or the miR-2703 mimic, but there were no significant differences in vitellogenin (NlVg) expression or in total oviposition relative to the control group. However, 90.68 and 46.13% of the eggs laid by the females injected with dsNlCHSA and miR-2703 mimic were unable to hatch, respectively.

The influence of down regulating expression of sugar transporter genes on insect growth, development, and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suspect that transporter-mediated uptake of dietary sugar is essential to the biology of phloem-feeding insects. Based on this reasoning, we posed the hypothesis that silencing, or reducing expression, of a BPH sugar transporter gene would be deleterious to the insects. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of Nlst6 knockdown on BPH biology. Reducing expression of Nlst6 led to profound effects on BPHs. It significantly prolonged the pre-oviposition period, shortened the oviposition period, decreased the number of eggs deposited and reduced body weight, compared to controls. Nlst6 knockdown also significantly decreased fat body and ovarian (particularly vitellogenin) protein content as well as vitellogenin gene expression. Experimental BPHs accumulated less fat body glucose compared to controls.

Here, we report that the insect ecdysone receptor (EcR) is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a serious insect pest of rice plants. We demonstrated that the use of a 360 bp fragment (NlEcR-c) that is common between NlEcR-A and NlEcR-B for feeding RNAi experiments significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of NlEcR compared with those in the dsGFP control. Feeding RNAi also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of offspring per pair of N. lugens. Consequently, a transgenic rice line expressing NlEcR dsRNA was constructed by Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the total copy number of the target gene in all transgenic rice lines was 2. Northern blot analysis showed that the small RNA of the hairpin dsNlEcR-c was successfully expressed in the transgenic rice lines. After newly hatched nymphs of N. lugens fed on the transgenic rice lines, effective RNAi was observed. The NlEcR expression levels in all lines examined were decreased significantly compared with the control. In all lines, the survival rate of the nymphs was nearly 90%, and the average number of offspring per pair in the treated groups was significantly less than that observed in the control, with a decrease of 44.18-66.27%. These findings support an RNAi-based pest control strategy and are also important for the management of rice insect pests.',{'entities': [(11,28,'Gene'),(370,387,'Gene'),(389,392,'Gene'),(456,473,'Species'),(474,492,'Species'),(519,523,'Species'),(583,588,'Gene'),(615,620,'Gene'),(627,632,'Gene'),(727,732,'Gene'),(868,877,'Species'),(906,910,'Species'),(927,932,'Gene'),(1092,1096,'Species'),(1229,1233,'Species'),(1271,1280,'Species'),(1303,1307,'Species'),(1348,1353,'Gene'),(1774,1778,'Species')]}),('The expression of Spodoptera exigua P450 and UGT genes: tissue specificity and response to insecticides. Cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) as phase I and phase II metabolism enzymes, respectively, play vital roles in the breakdown of endobiotics and xenobiotics. Insects can increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress from xenobiotics including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms for insecticide detoxification in Spodoptera exigua remain elusive, and the genes conferring insecticide metabolisms in this species are less well reported. In this study, 68 P450 and 32 UGT genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed gene expansions in CYP3 and CYP4 clans of P450 genes and UGT33 family of this pest. P450 and UGT genes exhibited specific tissue expression patterns. Insecticide treatments in fat body cells of S. exigua revealed that the expression levels of P450 and UGT genes were significantly influenced by challenges of abamectin, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorantraniliprole, metaflumizone and indoxacarb. Multiple genes for detoxification were affected in expression levels after insecticide exposures. The results demonstrated that lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorantraniliprole, metaflumizone and indoxacarb induced similar responses in the expression of P450 and UGT genes in fat body cells; eight P450 genes and four UGT genes were co-up-regulated significantly, and no or only a few CYP/UGT genes were down-regulated significantly by these four insecticides. However, abamectin triggered a distinct response for P450 and UGT gene expression; more P450 and UGT genes were down-regulated by abamectin than by the other four compounds.

Carboxylesterases are one of the major enzyme families involved in the detoxification of pyrethroids. Up-regulation of carboxylesterase genes is thought to be a major component of insecticide resistant mechanisms in insects. Based on the house fly transcriptome and genome database, a total of 39 carboxylesterase genes of different functional clades have been identified in house flies. In this study, eleven of these genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in the resistant ALHF house fly strain compared with susceptible aabys and wild-type CS strains. Eight up-regulated carboxylesterase genes with their expression levels were further induced to a higher level in response to permethrin treatments, indicating that constitutive and inductive overexpression of carboxylesterases are co-responsible for the enhanced detoxification of insecticides. Spatial expression studies revealed these up-regulated genes to be abundantly distributed in fat bodies and genetically mapped on autosome 2 or 3 of house flies, and their expression could be regulated by factors on autosome 1, 2 and 5.

The full length cDNA encoding CsGluCl was cloned from the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker). Multiple cDNA sequence alignment revealed three variants of CsGluCl generated by alternative splicing of exon 3 and exon 9. While all the transcripts were predominantly expressed in both nerve cord and brain, the expression patterns of these three variants differed among other tissues and developmental stages. Specifically, the expression level of CsGluCl C in cuticle was similar to that in nerve cord and brain, and was the predominant variant in late pupae and early adult stages. Both injection and oral delivery of dsGluCl significantly reduced the mRNA level of CsGluCl. Increased susceptibility to abamectin and reduced larvae growth and pupation rate were observed in dsGluCl-treated larvae.

The transmembrane receptors of the Toll superfamily play an important role in activating immune response, however, the function of silkworm Toll family member 18 Wheeler (18 W) remained unclear. Here, the 18w gene in silkworm was characterized. A relatively high transcription level of Bm18w mRNA was found in Malpighian tubules, and in eggs, larvae pre-molt to fourth instar, pupae and adults. When silkworm larvae were infected with E. coli or S. aureus, Bm18w showed a significant response, especially to E. coli, but did not have antibacterial activity. To further identify the downstream antimicrobial peptide genes of Bm18w, expression of Bm18w was knocked down with siRNA in vitro, resulting in significant decreases of cecropin-A, gloverin 2, and moricin B3. The overexpression of Bm18w was carried out using pIZT/V5-His-mCherry insect vector in BmN cells and significant upregulation of cecropin-A and gloverin 2 was detected, as well as upregulation of attacin and defensin.

Our previous study showed that phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b is related to the embryonic diapause process in Bombyx. However, the upstream signaling pathway was not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined bombyxin/Akt signaling in relation to the embryonic diapause process of B. mori. Results showed that GSK-3b phosphorylation stimulated by dechorionation was blocked by LY294002, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, indicating involvement of PI3K in GSK-3b phosphorylation in dechorionated eggs. Direct determination of Akt phosphorylation showed that dechorionation stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The Akt phosphorylation was blocked by LY294002. Temporal changes in Akt phosphorylation showed that different changing patterns exist between diapause and developing eggs. Relatively higher phosphorylation levels of Akt were detected between days 3 and 5 after oviposition in non-diapause eggs compared to those at the same stages in diapause eggs. Upon treatment with HCl, which prevents diapause initiation, Akt phosphorylation levels exhibited a later and much broader peak compared to diapause eggs. Examination of expression levels of the bombyxin-Z1 gene showed that in diapause eggs, a major peak occurred 1  day after oviposition, and its level then sharply decreased on day 2. However, in both non-diapause and HCl-treated eggs, a major broad peak was detected between days 1 and 4 after oviposition. These temporal changes in bombyxin-Z1 gene expression levels during embryonic stages coincided with changes in Akt phosphorylation, indicating that bombyxin-Z1 is likely an upstream signaling component for Akt phosphorylation.

The aim of this study was to explore the key visual genes that are linked to the host plant location of the fruit fly, Bactrocera minax. RESULTS: Using a host specialist fruit fly, B. minax, which lays eggs only into immature green citrus fruit, we undertook behavioral, transcriptomic, and RNAi research to identify the molecular basis for host fruit color recognition. In laboratory and field assays we found that adults prefer green over other colors, and this preference is significantly increased in sexually mature over immature flies. Furthermore, we identified that the Rh6 gene, responsible for green spectral sensitivity, has elevated expression in mature flies over immature flies. RNAi suppression of Rh6 eliminated the preference for green, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of eggs laid by B. minax in green unripe citrus.

In this study, we have investigated if ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, a major component of the defensome machinery, are involved in defence against the insecticide permethrin, in susceptible larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto.

The inhibition of ABC transporters increased the larval mortality by about 15-fold. Likewise, three genes were up-regulated after exposure to permethrin, showing different patterns of expression across the 48 h.

Remarkable lineage-specific expansion in this subfamily was observed reflecting that these CTLDPs, as important receptors, have evolved diversified members in response to a variety of microbes. Prediction of binding ligands revealed that T. xiaojinensis, a cold-adapted species, conserved the ability of CRDs to combine with Ca2+ to keep its receptors from freezing.

BACKGROUND: The oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a widespread agricultural pest, has evolved resistance to many insecticides, including organophosphorus compounds. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in xenobiotic detoxification and insecticide resistance in many insects. However, the role of delta class GSTs in detoxifying malathion in B. dorsalis is unknown. Here, we evaluated the roles of two delta class GSTs in malathion detoxification in this species. RESULTS: Two delta class GSTs genes, BdGSTd1 and BdGSTd10, were characterized in B. dorsalis. They were highly expressed in 5-day-old adults, as well as in midgut and Malpighian tubules. Upon malathion exposure, the two genes were upregulated by 2.63- and 2.85-fold, respectively. Injection of double-stranded RNA targeting BdGSTd1 or BdGSTd10 significantly reduced their mRNA levels in adults and also significantly increased adult susceptibility to malathion. The expression of these two GSTs in Escherichia coli helped the host to endure malathion stress at a concentration of 10  g  mL-1 according to a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses indicated that malathion could be significantly depleted by the two delta GSTs. The role of BdGSTd10 in malathion sequestration was also discussed.

Analysis of the subcellular localization of CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 in larval and pupal stages revealed that CYP4G16 preserves its PM localization across developmental stages analyzed; however CYPG17 is differentially localized in two distinct types of pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes of larval and adult developmental specificity.

In the plant-insect arms race, plants synthesize toxic compounds to defend against herbivorous insects, whereas insects employ cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) to detoxify these phytotoxins. As ubiquitous environmental contaminants, heavy metals can be easily absorbed by plants and further accumulated in herbivorous insects through the food chains, resulting in tangible consequences for plant-insect interactions. However, whether heavy metals can influence P450 activities and thereby cause further effects on larval tolerance to phytotoxins remains unknown. In this study, we shown that prior exposure to copper (Cu) enhanced larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in Spodoptera litura, a major polyphagous pest of agriculture. P450 activities were induced in larvae exposed to Cu or xanthotoxin, and a midgut specific expressed P450 gene, CYP6B50 was cross-induced after exposure to these two toxic xenobiotics. Knocking down CYP6B50 by RNA interference (RNAi) rendered the larvae more sensitive to xanthotoxin. As defense against oxidative stress following metal exposure has been demonstrated to affect insecticide resistance, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed. Cu exposure caused the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in larval midgut. In addition, two antioxidant response elements (AREs) were identified from the CYP6B50 promoter, indicating that Cu-induced CYP6B50 expression may be related to the ROS burst. Application of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively suppressed CYP6B50 expression, inhibited P450 activities and impaired larval tolerance to xanthotoxin that had been induced by Cu. These results indicate that the increase in CYP6B50 expression regulated by Cu-induced H2O2 generation contributed to the enhancement of larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in S. litura.

Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of NlNompC in the third-instar nymphs successfully knocked down the target gene with 75% suppression. At nine days after injection, the survival rate of dsRNA injected nymphs was as low as 9.84%. Behavioral observation revealed that the locomotion of the dsRNA injected nymphs was defective with much less movement compared to the negative control. Feeding and honeydew excretion of the dsRNA injected insects also decreased significantly. These results suggested that NlNompC is a classical mechanotransduction channel that plays important roles in proprioception and locomotion, and is essential for the survival of N. lugens. The results also contribute to the understanding of how TRP channels regulate proprioception.',{'entities': [(4,9,'Gene'),(28,46,'Species'),(89,94,'Gene'),(288,293,'Gene'),(302,320,'Species'),(322,329,'Gene'),(348,355,'Gene'),(543,550,'Gene'),(648,655,'Gene'),(1114,1121,'Gene'),(1263,1272,'Species')]}),('Characterization of two copper/zinc superoxide dismutases (Cu/Zn-SODs) from the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis and their activities in protecting E. coli cells against cold. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are crucial in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, studies regarding SOD functions in insects under cold conditions are rare. In this paper, two novel Cu/Zn-SOD genes in the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis, an extracellular copper/zinc SOD (MpecCu/Zn-SOD) and an intracellular copper/zinc SOD (MpicCu/Zn-SOD), were identified and characterized. The results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that MpecCu/Zn-SOD expression was significantly up-regulated by 4   C exposure for 0.5  h, but MpicCu/Zn-SOD was not. Superoxide anion radical (O2  -) content in beetles under 4   C exposure for 0.5  h showed an initial sharp increase and fluctuated during the cold treatment period, which was consistent with the relative mRNA level of MpecCu/Zn-SOD. The total SOD activity in the beetle was negatively correlated to the O2  - content with a correlation coefficient of -0.437. An E. coli system was employed to study the function of each MpCu/Zn-SOD gene. The fusion proteins Trx-His-MpCu/Zn-SODs were over expressed in E. coli BL21 using pET32a vector, and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The transformed bacteria BL21(pET32a-MpecCu/Zn-SOD) and BL21(pET32a-MpicCu/Zn-SOD) showed increased cold tolerance to -4   C as well as increased SOD activity compared to the control BL21(pET32a). The relative conductivity and malondialdehyde content in the two MpCu/Zn-SODs transformed bacteria under -4   C were significantly lower than the control BL21(pET32a). Furthermore, BL21(pET32a-MpecCu/Zn-SOD) had significantly higher SOD activity and cold tolerance than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu/Zn-SOD) under -4   C treatment, and had lower conductivity than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu/Zn-SOD). In conclusion, low temperature led to the accumulation of O2  - in M. punctipennis, which stimulated the expression of extracellular MpCu/Zn-SOD gene and the increase of total SOD activity. E. coli overexpressing Trx-His-MpCu/Zn-SODs increased resistance to cold treatment-induced oxidative stress.

A heterodimer of ultraspiracle (USP) and ecdysone receptor (EcR) mediates 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling cascade to regulate insect moulting and metamorphosis. However, at least two questions remain to be addressed in terms of the molecular importance of USP in insect species. First, is USP involved in both regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis and mediation of 20E signalling in non-drosophilid insects, as in Drosophila melanogaster? Second, does USP play any role in larval metamorphosis except as the partner of heterodimeric receptor to activate the downstream 20E signalling genes? In this paper, we found that RNA interference (RNAi) of LdUSP in the final (fourth) instar larvae reduced the messenger RNA levels of four ecdysteroidogenesis genes (Ldspo, Ldphm, Lddib and Ldsad) and 20E titre, and repressed the expression of five 20E signal genes (EcRA, HR3, HR4, E74 and E75) in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The LdUSP RNAi larvae remained as prepupae, with developing antennae, legs and discs of forewings and hindwings. Dietary supplement with 20E restored the expression of the five 20E signal genes, but only partially alleviated the decreased pupation rate in LdUSP RNAi beetles. Knockdown of LdUSP at the penultimate (third) instar larvae did not affect third-fourth instar moulting. However, silencing LdUSP caused similar but less severe impairments on pupation. Accordingly, we propose that USP is undoubtedly necessary for ecdysteroidogenesis, for mediation of 20E signalling and for initiation of metamorphosis in L. decemlineata.',{'entities': [(31,44,'Gene'),(48,73,'Species'),(121,134,'Gene'),(136,139,'Gene'),(145,162,'Gene'),(164,167,'Gene'),(364,367,'Gene'),(397,400,'Gene'),(518,541,'Species'),(556,559,'Gene'),(751,756,'Gene'),(861,866,'Gene'),(868,873,'Gene'),(875,880,'Gene'),(885,890,'Gene'),(994,1019,'Species'),(1025,1030,'Gene'),(1277,1282,'Gene'),(1310,1315,'Gene'),(1421,1426,'Gene'),(1512,1515,'Gene'),(1637,1652,'Species')]}),('Metabolism of selected model substrates and insecticides by recombinant CYP6FD encoded by its gene predominately expressed in the brain of Locusta migratoria.

These enzymes play a major role in developing insecticide resistance in many insect species. In this study, we heterologously co-expressed a CYP enzyme (CYP6FD1) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from L.  migartoria in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for metabolic activity towards six selected model substrates (luciferin-H, luciferin-Me, luciferin-Be, luciferin-PFBE, luciferin-CEE and 7-ethoxycoumarin), and four selected insecticides (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and methoprene). Recombinant CYP6FD1 showed activity towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and luciferin-Me, but no detectable activity towards the other luciferin derivatives. Furthermore, the enzyme efficiently oxidized deltamethrin to hydroxydeltamethrin through an aromatic hydroxylation in a time-dependent manner. However, the enzyme did not show any detectable activity towards the other three insecticides. Our results provide direct evidence that CYP6FD1 is capable of metabolizing deltamethrin.

Rapid evolution of resistance by insect pests severely jeopardizes the sustainable utilization of biopesticides and transgenic crops that produce insecticidal crystal proteins derived from the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Recently, high levels of resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins have been reported to be genetically linked to the mutation or down-regulation of ABC transporter subfamily C genes ABCC2 and ABCC3 in seven lepidopteran insects, including Plutella xylostella (L.). To further determine the causal relationship between alterations in the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes and Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella, the novel CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system was utilized to successfully construct two knockout strains: the ABCC2KO strain is homozygous for a 4-bp deletion in exon 3 of the PxABCC2 gene, and the ABCC3KO strain is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 of the PxABCC3 gene, both of which can produce only truncated ABCC proteins. Bioassay results indicated that high levels of resistance to the Cry1Ac protoxin were observed in both the ABCC2KO (724-fold) and ABCC3KO (413-fold) strains compared to the original susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. Subsequently, dominance degree and genetic complementation tests demonstrated that Cry1Ac resistance in both the knockout strains was incompletely recessive, and Cry1Ac resistance alleles were located in the classic BtR-1 resistance locus that harbored the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes, similar to the near-isogenic resistant NIL-R strain. Moreover, qualitative toxin binding assays revealed that the binding of the Cry1Ac toxin to midgut brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) in both knockout strains was dramatically reduced compared to that in the susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. In summary, our CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing study presents, for the first time, in vivo reverse genetics evidence for both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins as midgut functional receptors for Bt Cry1 toxins in insects, which provides new insight into the pivotal roles of both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins in the complex molecular mechanism of insect resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins.',{'entities': [(42,49,'Gene'),(54,61,'Gene'),(101,123,'Species'),(144,160,'Species'),(162,181,'Species'),(408,430,'Species'),(432,434,'Species'),(476,478,'Species'),(607,612,'Gene'),(617,622,'Gene'),(664,683,'Species'),(762,769,'Gene'),(774,781,'Gene'),(813,826,'Species'),(1007,1014,'Gene'),(1095,1102,'Gene'),(1633,1640,'Gene'),(1645,1652,'Gene'),(2089,2094,'Gene'),(2099,2104,'Gene'),(2149,2151,'Species'),(2238,2243,'Gene'),(2248,2253,'Gene'),(2322,2324,'Species')]}),('Molecular characterization, spatial-temporal expression and magnetic response patterns of iron-sulfur cluster assembly1 (IscA1) in the rice planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.

BACKGROUND: Arboviruses are controlled through insecticide control of their mosquito vector. However, inconsiderate use of insecticides often results in the selection of resistance in treated populations, so that monitoring is required to optimize their usage. Here, Culex pipiens (West Nile and Rift Valley Fever virus vector) specimens were collected from four Moroccan cities. Levels of susceptibility to the organophosphate (OP) insecticide malathion were assessed using World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended bioassays. Individual mosquitoes were tested for the presence of the G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene, the main OP-target resistance mutation. RESULTS: Bioassays showed that mosquitoes from Mohammedia were significantly more resistant to malathion than those from Marrakech. Analyzing the ace-1 genotypes in dead and surviving individuals suggested that other resistance mechanisms may be present in Mohammedia. The ace-1 resistance allele frequencies were relatively moderate (< 0.4). Their analyses in three Moroccan cities (Tangier, Casablanca and Marrakech) however showed disparities between two coexisting Cx. pipiens forms and revealed that the G119S mutation tends to be more frequent in urban than in rural collection sites.

We expressed BmNinaB and TcNinaB in E. coli and analyzed their biochemical properties. Both enzymes catalyzed a conversion of carotenoids into cis-retinoids.

BACKGROUND: Laodelphax striatellus, the small brown planthopper (SBPH), is an economically important pest, besides sucking damage, which transmits rice viruses to cause severe damages to rice. In the process of virus transmission, the host orientation behavior of insect is mainly driven by olfaction. In this context, the molecular basis of olfaction in SBPH is of particular interest. RESULTS: Here, we identified the gene that encodes olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) and analyzed its expression profiles in Rice stripe virus (RSV)-infected and RSV-free SBPH. It was found that LstrOrco shared high identity with other Orcos from different order insects. LstrOrco was mainly expressed in the head of SBPH, and its expression was significantly stimulated by RSV-infection. The behavioral bioassay revealed that viruliferous SBPH might have a stronger olfactory and seeking ability for rice than RSV-free insect. After silencing of LstrOrco expression, the olfaction and seeking behavior of nymphs for rice seedlings was significantly inhibited, mainly in the increase of the  no response  percent and the prolongation of the response time. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that Orco played an important role in olfactory signaling and seeking behavior of SBPH, which provided a basic for future development of olfactory-based agriculture pest management strategies.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry.',{'entities': [(0,21,'Gene'),(22,26,'Gene'),(41,58,'Species'),(101,124,'Species'),(138,160,'Species'),(166,189,'Species'),(191,195,'Species'),(273,277,'Species'),(313,317,'Species'),(481,485,'Species'),(564,594,'Gene'),(596,600,'Gene'),(642,659,'Species'),(688,692,'Species'),(712,720,'Gene'),(789,797,'Gene'),(834,838,'Species'),(957,961,'Species'),(1018,1022,'Species'),(1064,1072,'Gene'),(1134,1138,'Species'),(1314,1318,'Gene'),(1391,1395,'Species')]}),('Downregulation of dystrophin expression in pupae of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci inhibits the emergence of adults. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a major pest to agriculture. Adults are is able to fly for long distances and to colonize staple crops, herbs and ornamentals, and to vector viruses belonging to several important taxonomic groups. During their early development, whiteflies mature from eggs through several nymphal stages (instars I to IV) until adults emerge from pupae. We aim at reducing whitefly populations by inhibiting the emergence of adults from nymphs. Here we targeted dystrophin, a conserved protein essential for the development of the muscle system in human, animals and insects. We have exploited the fact that whitefly nymphs developing on tomato leaves feed from the plant phloem via their stylets. Thus, we delivered dystrophin-silencing dsRNA to nymphs developing on leaves of tomato plantlets with their roots bathing in the silencing solution. Downregulation of dystrophin expression occurred mainly in pupae. Dystrophin silencing induced also the downregulation of the dystrophin-associated protein genes actin and tropomyosin, and disrupted F-actin. Most significant, the treatment inhibited the emergence of adults from pupae, suggesting that targeting dystrophin may help restraining whitefly populations.

Insect eye coloration arises from the accumulation of various pigments. A number of genes that function in the biosynthesis (vermilion, cinnabar, and cardinal) and importation (karmoisin, white, scarlet, and brown) of these pigments, and their precursors, have been identified in diverse species and used as markers for transgenesis and gene editing. To examine their suitability as visible markers in Lygus hesperus Knight (western tarnished plant bug), transcriptomic data were screened for sequences exhibiting homology with the Drosophila melanogaster proteins.

Bioinformatic-based sequence and phylogenetic analyses supported initial annotations as eye coloration genes. Consistent with their proposed role, each of the genes was expressed in adult heads as well as throughout nymphal and adult development. Adult eyes of those injected with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) for karmoisin, vermilion, cinnabar, cardinal, and scarlet were characterized by a red band along the medial margin extending from the rostral terminus to the antenna.

In the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori, although the lack of vasa homolog (BmVLG) protein localization as well as microscopic observation suggested the lack of germplasm, classical embryo manipulation studies and the localization pattern of Bm-nosO (one of the four nanos genes in Bombyx) maternal mRNA in the egg raised the possibility that an inheritance mode is operating in Bombyx. Here, we generated Bm-nosO knockouts to examine whether the localized mRNA acts as a localized germ cell determinant. Contrary to our expectations, Bm-nosO knockout lines could be established. However, these lines frequently produced abnormal eggs, which failed to hatch, to various extent depending on the individuals. We also found that Bm-nosO positively regulated BmVLG expression at least during embryonic stage, directly or indirectly, indicating that these genes were on the same developmental pathway for germ cell formation in Bombyx. These results suggest that these conserved genes are concerned with stable germ cell production. On the other hand, from the aspect of BmVLG as a PGC marker, we showed that maternal Bm-nosO product(s) as well as early zygotic Bm-nosO activity were redundantly involved in PGC specification; elimination of both maternal and zygotic gene activities (as in knockout lines) resulted in the apparent lack of PGCs, indicating that an inheritance mechanism indeed operates in Bombyx. This, however, together with the fact that germ cells are produced at all in Bm-nosO knockout lines, also suggests the possibility that, in Bombyx, not only this inheritance mechanism but also an inductive mechanism acts in concert to form germ cells or that loss of early PGCs are compensated for by germline regeneration: mechanisms that could enable the evolution of preformation. Thus, Bombyx could serve as an important organism in understanding the evolution of germ cell formation mechanisms; transition between preformation and inductive modes.',{'entities': [(63,70,'Gene'),(92,97,'Gene'),(265,269,'Gene'),(274,279,'Gene'),(445,456,'Species'),(479,483,'Gene'),(493,498,'Gene'),(659,666,'Gene'),(684,689,'Gene'),(823,830,'Gene'),(952,959,'Gene'),(1143,1150,'Gene'),(1172,1177,'Gene'),(1483,1488,'Gene'),(1530,1537,'Gene'),(1574,1581,'Gene'),(1903,1910,'Gene')]}),('Function and pharmacology of glutamate-gated chloride channel exon 9 splice variants from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) are found only in invertebrates and mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission. The structural and functional diversity of GluCls are produced through assembly of multiple subunits and via posttranscriptional alternations. Alternative splicing is the most common way to achieve this in insect GluCls and splicing occurs primarily at exons 3 and 9. As expression pattern and pharmacological properties of exon 9 alternative splices in invertebrate GluCls remain poorly understood, the cDNAs encoding three alternative splice variants (9a, 9b and 9c) of the PxGluCl gene from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella were constructed and their pharmacological characterizations were examined using electrophysiological studies. Alternative splicing of exon 9 had little to no impact on PxGluCl sensitivity towards the agonist glutamate when subunits were singly or co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, the allosteric modulator abamectin and the chloride channel blocker fipronil had differing effects on PxGluCl splice variants. PxGluCl9c channels were more resistant to abamectin and PxGluCl9b channels were more sensitive to fipronil than other homomeric channels. In addition, heteromeric channels containing different splice variants showed similar sensitivity to abamectin (except for 9c) and reduced sensitivity to fipronil than homomeric channels. These findings suggest that functionally indistinguishable but pharmacologically distinct GluCls could be formed in P. xylostella and that the upregulated constitutive expression of the specific variants may contribute to the evolution of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella and other arthropods.',{'entities': [(29,61,'Gene'),(94,110,'Species'),(111,130,'Species'),(132,165,'Gene'),(167,173,'Gene'),(297,303,'Gene'),(467,473,'Gene'),(621,627,'Gene'),(730,737,'Gene'),(752,768,'Species'),(769,788,'Species'),(958,965,'Gene'),(1053,1060,'Species'),(1185,1192,'Gene'),(1210,1219,'Gene'),(1266,1275,'Gene'),(1626,1632,'Gene'),(1652,1665,'Species'),(1801,1814,'Species')]}),('Sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on molting hormone levels and mRNA expressions of three Halloween genes in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.

Notably, the transcript levels of CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 were induced after treatment with sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in specific developmental stages. These results indicated that chlorantraniliprole had adverse effects on insect MH biosynthesis, and in addition to the involvement in MH biosynthesis, CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 may also play important roles in the detoxification metabolism of chlorantraniliprole in C. suppressalis.',{'entities': [(97,106,'Gene'),(120,124,'Species'),(137,155,'Species'),(496,514,'Species'),(657,666,'Gene'),(683,693,'Gene'),(695,705,'Gene'),(710,720,'Gene'),(724,739,'Species'),(816,831,'Species'),(992,1001,'Gene'),(1067,1082,'Species'),(1118,1128,'Gene'),(1130,1140,'Gene'),(1145,1155,'Gene'),(1423,1433,'Gene'),(1435,1445,'Gene'),(1450,1460,'Gene'),(1550,1565,'Species')]}),('Downregulation of imidacloprid resistant genes alters the biological parameters in Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (chrysomelidae: Coleoptera).

The majority of Osiris genes exist in a highly syntenic cluster, and the cluster itself appears to have arisen very early in the evolution of insects. We used developmental gene expression in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, and the wood ant, Formica exsecta, to compare patterns of Osiris gene expression both during development and between alternate caste phenotypes in the polymorphic social insects. Developmental gene expression of Osiris genes is highly conserved across species and correlated with gene location and evolutionary history. The social insect castes are highly divergent in pupal Osiris gene expression. Sets of co-expressed genes that include Osiris genes are enriched in gene ontology terms related to chitin/cuticle and peptidase activity. Osiris genes are essential for cuticle formation in both embryos and pupae, and genes co-expressed with Osiris genes affect wing development.

We generate somatic clones with simultaneous loss of tumor suppressor, Lgl, and gain of the posterior compartment selector, Engrailed (En), known to induce synthesis of Hh. We show that lgl UAS-en clones in the anterior wing compartment trigger Hh signaling cascade via cross-talk with their Ci-expressing wild type cell neighbors. Hh-Dpp signaling from clone boundaries of such ectopically formed de novo organizers in turn drive lgl carcinogenesis.

Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although an L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations - Asendabo, Chewaka and Tolay - and two susceptible strains - Sekoru and Mozambique. RESULTS: Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4, were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance. Although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle, a higher cuticular hydrocarbon content was observed in a resistant population.

The full-length cDNA of N. lugens TPS (NlTPS) is 3235 bp and has an open reading frame of 2424 bp, encoding a protein of 807 amino acids. NlTPS was expressed in the fat body, midgut and ovary. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that NlTPS mRNA is expressed continuously with little change during the life of the insect. Efficient silencing of the TPS gene through double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) feeding led to rapid and significant reduction levels of TPS mRNA and enzymatic activity. Additionally, the development of N. lugens larvae that had been fed with the dsRNA was disturbed, resulting in lethality, and the cumulative survival rates dropped to 75.56, 64.44, 55.56 and 40.00% after continuous ingestion of 0.5  g/ l dsRNA for 2, 4, 7 and 10 days, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those of the insects in the control group, suggesting that NlTPS dsRNA may be useful as a means of insect pest control.',{'entities': [(36,64,'Gene'),(77,94,'Species'),(96,114,'Species'),(120,137,'Species'),(139,157,'Species'),(183,187,'Species'),(519,547,'Gene'),(549,552,'Gene'),(557,566,'Species'),(592,601,'Species'),(602,605,'Gene'),(607,612,'Gene'),(706,711,'Gene'),(821,826,'Gene'),(935,938,'Gene'),(1037,1040,'Gene'),(1103,1112,'Species'),(1455,1460,'Gene')]}),('Native subunit composition of two insect nicotinic receptor subtypes with differing affinities for the insecticide imidacloprid. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively to control a variety of insect pest species. The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), an insect pest of rice crops throughout Asia, is an important target species for control with neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid. Studies with nAChRs purified from N. lugens have identified two [(3)H]imidacloprid binding sites with different affinities (K(d) = 3.5 +/- 0.6 pM and 1.5 +/- 0.2 nM). Co-immunoprecipitation studies with native preparations of N. lugens nAChRs, using subunit-selective antisera, have demonstrated the co-assembly of Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 subunits into one receptor complex and of Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 into another. Immunodepletion of Nlalpha1 or Nlalpha2 subunits resulted in the selective loss of the lower affinity imidacloprid binding site, whereas immunodepletion of Nlalpha3 or Nlalpha8 caused the selective loss of the high-affinity site. Immunodepletion of Nlbeta1 resulted in a complete absence of specific imidacloprid binding. In contrast, immunodepletion with antibodies selective for other N. lugens nAChR subunits (Nlalpha4, Nlalpha6, Nlalpha7 and Nlbeta2) had no significant effect on imidacloprid binding. Taken together, these data suggest that nAChRs containing Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 constitute the lower affinity binding site, whereas nAChRs containing Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 constitute the higher affinity binding site for imidacloprid in N. lugens.',{'entities': [(41,59,'Gene'),(212,245,'Gene'),(247,253,'Gene'),(329,346,'Species'),(348,366,'Species'),(387,391,'Species'),(525,531,'Gene'),(546,555,'Species'),(738,747,'Species'),(748,754,'Gene'),(1332,1341,'Species'),(1342,1347,'Gene'),(1491,1497,'Gene'),(1592,1598,'Gene'),(1705,1714,'Species')]}),('Heteromeric co-assembly of two insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunits: influence on sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively in areas of crop protection and animal health to control a variety of insect pest species. Here, we describe studies performed with nAChR subunits Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 cloned from the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a major insect pest of rice crops in many parts of Asia. The influence of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits upon the functional properties of recombinant nAChRs has been examined by expression in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, the influence of a Nlalpha1 mutation (Y151S), which has been linked to neonicotinoid lab generated resistance in N. lugens, has been examined. As in previous studies of insect alpha subunits, functional expression has been achieved by co-expression with the mammalian beta2 subunit. This approach has revealed a significantly higher apparent affinity of imidacloprid for Nlalpha1/beta2 than for Nlalpha2/beta2 nAChRs. In addition, evidence has been obtained for the co-assembly of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits into  triplet  nAChRs of subunit composition Nlalpha1/Nlalpha2/beta2. Evidence has also been obtained which demonstrates that the resistance-associated Y151S mutation has a significantly reduced effect on neonicotinoid agonist activity when Nlalpha1 is co-assembled with Nlalpha2 than when expressed as the sole alpha subunit in a heteromeric nAChR.

BACKGROUND: Doublesex (dsx), the downstream gene in the insect sex-determination pathway, is a key regulator of sexually dimorphic development and behavior across a variety of insects. Manipulating expression of dsx could be useful in the genetic control of insects. However, information on the sex-specific function of dsx in non-model insects is lacking. RESULTS: In this work, we isolated a dsx homolog, which is alternatively spliced into six female-specific and one male-specific isoforms, from an important agricultural pest, the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. Studies on the expression of sex-specific Aidsx mRNA during embryonic development showed that the sixth hour post oviposition is the key stage for sex determination in A. ipsilon. Functional analysis of Aidsx was conducted using a CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting female- and male-specific Aidsx exons. Disruptions of sex-specific Aidsx exons resulted in sex-specific, sexually dimorphic defects in external genitals, gonads and antennae, and expression of sex-specific genes as well as production of offspring in both sexes. CONCLUSION: Our results not only demonstrate that dsx is a key player determining A. ipsilon sexually dimorphic traits, but also provide a potential method for the genetic control of this pest.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry.',{'entities': [(27,36,'Gene'),(95,108,'Species'),(110,125,'Species'),(139,148,'Gene'),(150,153,'Gene'),(339,342,'Gene'),(447,450,'Gene'),(521,524,'Gene'),(663,676,'Species'),(678,693,'Species'),(737,742,'Gene'),(863,873,'Species'),(898,903,'Gene'),(981,986,'Gene'),(1022,1027,'Gene'),(1267,1270,'Gene')]}),('Downregulation of female doublesex expression by oral-mediated RNA interference reduces number and fitness of Anopheles gambiae adult females. BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne diseases affect millions worldwide, with malaria alone killing over 400 thousand people per year and affecting hundreds of millions. To date, the best strategy to prevent the disease remains insecticide-based mosquito control. However, insecticide resistance as well as economic and social factors reduce the effectiveness of the current methodologies. Alternative control technologies are in development, including genetic control such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). The SIT is a pivotal tool in integrated agricultural pest management and could be used to improve malaria vector control. To apply the SIT and most other newer technologies against disease transmitting mosquitoes, it is essential that releases are composed of males with minimal female contamination. The removal of females is an essential requirement because released females can themselves contribute towards nuisance biting and disease transmission. Thus, females need to be eliminated from the cohorts prior to release. Manual separation of Anopheles gambiae pupae or adult mosquitoes based on morphology is time consuming, is not feasible on a large scale and has limited the implementation of the SIT technique. The doublesex (dsx) gene is one of the effector switches of sex determination in the process of sex differentiation in insects. Both males and females have specific splicing variants that are expressed across the different life stages. Using RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce expression of the female specific (dsxF) variant of this gene has proven to have detrimental effects to the females in other mosquito species, such as Aedes aegypti. We tested oral RNAi on dsx (AgdsxF) in An. gambiae. METHODS: We studied the expression pattern of the dsx gene in the An. gambiae G3 strain. We knocked down AgdsxF expression in larvae through oral delivery of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by bacteria and observed its effects in adults. RESULTS: Our results show that feeding of AgdsxF dsRNA can effectively reduce (>  66%) the mRNA of female dsx transcript and that there is a concomitant reduction in the number of female larvae that achieve adulthood. Control groups produced 52% (   3.9% SE) of adult males and 48% (   4.0% SE) females, while AgdsxF dsRNA treated groups had 72.1% (   4.0% SE) males vs 27.8% females (   3.3% SE). In addition, the female adults produce fewer progeny, 37.1% (   8.2% SE) less than the controls. The knockdown was sex-specific and had no impact on total numbers of viable male adults, in the male dsx transcripts or male fitness parameters such as longevity or body size. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that RNAi could be used to improve novel mosquito control strategies that require efficient sex separation and male-only release of An. gambiae by targeting sex determination genes such as AgdsxF. The advantages of using RNAi in a controlled setting for mosquito rearing are numerous, as the dose and time of exposure are controlled, and the possibility of off-target effects and the waste of female production would be significantly reduced.',{'entities': [(25,34,'Gene'),(110,127,'Species'),(1191,1208,'Species'),(1368,1377,'Gene'),(1379,1382,'Gene'),(1791,1804,'Species'),(1829,1832,'Gene'),(1834,1840,'Gene'),(1845,1856,'Species'),(1908,1911,'Gene'),(1924,1935,'Species'),(1963,1969,'Gene'),(2056,2064,'Species'),(2143,2149,'Gene'),(2207,2210,'Gene'),(2288,2294,'Species'),(2369,2374,'Species'),(2411,2417,'Gene'),(2462,2467,'Species'),(2672,2676,'Species'),(2692,2696,'Species'),(2697,2700,'Gene'),(2716,2720,'Species'),(2920,2924,'Species'),(2941,2952,'Species'),(2998,3004,'Gene')]}),('Knockdown of the aminopeptidase N genes decreases susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis larvae to Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticide is currently the most widely used bioinsecticide. Bt expressing cry genes are some of the most successful foreign-genome-inserting genes used in transgenic insect-resistant crop development. Cry toxins are resistant to lepidopteran pests, such as Chilo suppressalis, a major insect pest of rice worldwide. Since Cry toxins exert their activity by binding to specific receptors in the midgut of target insects, identification of functional Cry toxin receptors in the midgut of C. suppressalis larvae is crucial to evaluate potential resistance mechanisms and develop effective strategies for inhibiting insect resistance. In this study, we isolated two aminopeptidase N genes (APN6 and APN8) from C. suppressalis and determined that they were expressed in the foregut. APN6 was highly expressed at the fourth instar, and APN8 was highly expressed in adult and pupa. Knockdown of CsAPN6 and CsAPN8 by RNA interference resulted in significantly decreased susceptibility of larvae to Bt rice varieties TT51 (expressing cry1Ac/cry1Ab fusion genes) and T1C-19 (expressing cry1Ca), but not T2A-1 (expressing cry2Aa).

These genes were critical for the regulation of the larva-to-adult transition. Eyg, as a functional target of miR-8-3p, participates in eye development, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and loss-of-function analyses.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect. RESULTS: CBP is ubiquitously expressed in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of CBP resulted in a decrease in JH induction of Kr-h1 gene expression in Tribolium larvae and led to a block in their development. Moreover, the injection of CBP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed lethal phenotypes within 8 days of injection. RNA-seq and subsequent differential gene expression analysis identified CBP target genes in Tribolium. Knockdown of CBP caused a decrease in the expression of 1306 genes coding for transcription factors and other proteins associated with growth and development. Depletion of CBP impaired the expression of several JH response genes (e.g., Kr-h1, Hairy, early trypsin) and ecdysone response genes (EcR, E74, E75, and broad complex). Further, GO enrichment analyses of the downregulated genes showed enrichment in different functions including developmental processes, pigmentation, anatomical structure development, regulation of biological and cellular processes, etc. CONCLUSION: These data suggest diverse but crucial roles for CBP during postembryonic development in the coleopteran model insect, Tribolium.

Our analyses reveal that Torso, Trunk and PTTH are evolutionarily labile components of the TAC with multiple individual or combined losses occurring in the arthropod lineages leading to and within the insects. These losses are often correlated, with both ligands and receptor missing from the genome of the same species. We determine that the PTTH gene evolved in the common ancestor of Hemiptera and Holometabola, and is missing from the genomes of a number of species with experimentally demonstrated PTTH activity, implying another molecule may be involved in ecdysis in these species. In contrast, the torso-like gene is a common component of pancrustacean genomes.',{'entities': [(17,22,'Gene'),(196,206,'Species'),(211,220,'Species'),(266,271,'Gene'),(338,343,'Gene'),(353,358,'Gene'),(391,395,'Gene'),(435,440,'Gene'),(733,738,'Gene'),(740,745,'Gene'),(750,754,'Gene'),(1051,1055,'Gene'),(1211,1215,'Gene'),(1314,1319,'Gene')]}),('Influence of Metarhizium anisopliae (IMI330189) and Mad1 protein on enzymatic activities and Toll-related genes of migratory locust. Efficacy of Metarhizium anisopliae strain (IMI330189) and Mad1 protein alone or in combination by feeding method to overcome immune-related enzymes and Toll-like pathway genes was investigated in migratory locust. M. anisopliae (IMI330189) is a potent and entomopathogenic fungal strain could be effectively used against insect pests. Similarly, Mad1 protein adheres to insect cuticle, causing virulence to insects. We confirmed maximum 55% of mortality when M. anisopliae (IMI330189) and Mad1 was applied in combination. Similarly, increased PO activity was observed in locust with combined dose of Mad1  +  IMI330189 whereas PO, POD, and SOD activities reduced using Mad1 independently. Four Toll-like signaling pathway genes (MyD88, Cactus, Pelle, and CaN) were investigated from midgut and body of the migratory locust after 72 h of treatments. Subsequently, the expression of MyD88 in the midgut and body significantly decreased with the application of Mad1 and Mad1  +  IMI330189. Performance of these treatments was absolutely non-consistent in both parts of insects. Meanwhile, IMI330189 significantly raised the expression of Cactus in both midgut and body. However, the combined treatment (Mad1  +  IMI330189) significantly reduced the Cactus expression in both body parts. Pelle expression was significantly increased in the midgut with the application of independent treatment of Mad1 and IMI330189 whereas the combined treatment (Mad1  +  IMI330189) suppressed the Pelle expression in midgut. Its expression level was absolutely higher in body with the application of IMI330189 and Mad1  +  IMI330189 only. On the other hand, Mad1 significantly increased the expression of CaN in midgut. However, all three treatments significantly affected and suppressed the expression of CaN gene in body of locust. This shows that the applications of M. anisopliae and Mad1 protein significantly affected Toll signaling pathway genes, which ultimately increased level of susceptibility of locust.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes that are involved in detoxification of electrophilic toxic compounds. Although the co-induced expression of GST genes by insecticides in insects has been documented in recent years, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not understood. In this study, a total of thirty-one cytosolic S. exigua GSTs (SeGSTs) was cloned and identified. The bioinformatics and gene expression patterns were also analyzed. Out of them, SeGSTe9, SeGSTs6, SeGSTe1, SeGSTe6, SeGSTe8, SeGSTe14, and SeGSTd1 were significantly co-expressed following exposure to three insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and chlorantraniliprole). The analysis of upstream sequences revealed that all of these seven SeGSTs harbored CncC/Maf binding site. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the pGL3-SeGST promoter construct exhibited a significant increase in luciferase activities after exposure to insecticides, and mutation of CncC/Maf binding site diminish the induction effect. These data indicate that CncC/Maf pathway regulates the co-expression of GST genes in response to different insecticides in S. exigua. Insecticides significantly enhanced the ROS content and treatment with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased the insecticide-induced luciferase activities of the PGL3-GSTe6 promoter construct, but not the CncC-mutated construct. These results indicate that ROS mediates GST gene expression after exposure to insecticides through CncC/Maf pathway.

BACKGROUND: The rice striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis (Walker), which is one of the most economically important phytophagous pests, has developed resistance to multiple insecticides. The resistance of SSB against chlorantraniliprole has been investigated in detail. However, the mechanism of its metabolic resistance has rarely been studied. RESULTS: A field population from Wuhu City, China was used to establish chlorantraniliprole resistant and susceptible strains (WHR and WHS) by laboratory continuous selection. Enzyme activities data suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in WHR. CYP6CV5, CYP9A68, CYP321F3, and CYP324A12 were significantly overexpressed in WHR (from 4.48 to 44.88-fold). These four P450 genes were expressed in the late developmental stages of WHR; however, they were almost absent during the egg stage. In addition, their expressions were much more sensitive to chlorantraniliprole induction in WHR than in WHS. Injection of individual and mixture dsRNAs reduced the expression of the four target genes (55.2-73.2% and 43.2-50.2%, respectively) and caused significant larvae mortality (55.1-65.1% and 88.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Multiple overexpressed P450 genes were potentially associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance, as confirmed by the RNA interference (RNAi) assay. Our findings suggested that metabolic resistance to chlorantraniliprole might be mediated by P450s.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry.',{'entities': [(31,60,'Gene'),(116,134,'Species'),(161,165,'Species'),(192,210,'Species'),(737,766,'Gene'),(775,782,'Gene'),(784,791,'Gene'),(793,801,'Gene'),(807,816,'Gene')]}),('Modular cis-regulatory logic of yellow gene expression in silkmoth larvae. Colour patterns in butterflies and moths are crucial traits for adaptation. Previous investigations have highlighted genes responsible for pigmentation (ie yellow and ebony). However, the mechanisms by which these genes are regulated in lepidopteran insects remain poorly understood. To elucidate this, molecular studies involving dipterans have largely analysed the cis-regulatory regions of pigmentation genes and have revealed cis-regulatory modularity. Here, we used well-developed transgenic techniques in Bombyx mori and demonstrated that cis-regulatory modularity controls tissue-specific expression of the yellow gene. We first identified which body parts are regulated by the yellow gene via black pigmentation. We then isolated three discrete regulatory elements driving tissue-specific gene expression in three regions of B. mori larvae. Finally, we found that there is no apparent sequence conservation of cis-regulatory regions between B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster, and no expression driven by the regulatory regions of one species when introduced into the other species. Therefore, the trans-regulatory landscapes of the yellow gene differ significantly between the two taxa. The results of this study confirm that lepidopteran species use cis-regulatory modules to control gene expression related to pigmentation, and represent a powerful cadre of transgenic tools for studying evolutionary developmental mechanisms.',{'entities': [(32,38,'Gene'),(58,66,'Species'),(231,237,'Gene'),(242,247,'Gene'),(586,597,'Species'),(689,695,'Gene'),(760,766,'Gene'),(908,915,'Species'),(1024,1031,'Species'),(1036,1059,'Species'),(1217,1223,'Gene')]}),('Targeting the potassium ion channel genes SK and SH as a novel approach for control of insect pests: efficacy and biosafety. BACKGROUND: Potassium ion channels play a critical role in the generation of electrical signals and thus provide potential targets for control of insect pests by RNA interference. RESULTS: Genes encoding the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) and the voltage-gated potassium channel (SH) were knocked down in Tribolium castaneum by injection and oral delivery of dsRNA (dsTcSK and dsTcSH, respectively). Irrespective of the delivery mechanism a dose-dependent effect was observed for knockdown (KD) of gene expression and insect mortality for both genes. Larvae fed a 400  ng dsRNA  mg-1 diet showed significant gene (P  <  0.05) knockdown (98% and 83%) for SK and SH, respectively, with corresponding mortalities of 100% and 98% after 7 days. When injected (248.4 ng  larva-1 ), gene KD was 99% and 98% for SK and SH, causing 100% and 73.4% mortality, respectively. All developmental stages tested (larvae, early- and late-stage pupae and adults) showed an RNAi-sensitive response for both genes. LC50 values were lower for SK than SH, irrespective of delivery method, demonstrating that the knockdown of SK had a greater effect on larval mortality. Biosafety studies using adult honeybee Apis mellifera showed that there were no significant differences either in expression levels or mortality of honeybees orally dosed with dsTcSK and dsTcSH compared to control-fed bees. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the titre of deformed wing virus, used as a measure of immune suppression, between experimental and control bees.

Transcription factor E93 is a steroid hormone ecdysone early response gene and plays crucial roles in both the degradation of larval tissues and the formation of adult organs during insect metamorphosis with the prepupal-pupal-adult transition. However, the molecular mechanism underlying E93 regulation is poorly understood. In this study, we found that specific knockdown of the E93 gene in the Drosophila wing disrupted wing development. Analyzing ChIP-seq signals for E93 in Drosophila wing identified that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) gene was a potential downstream target of E93. ChIP-PCR analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that E93 could bind to the Dpp promoter and enhanced its activity. Furthermore, the expressions of Dpp and other components in the Dpp signaling pathway were upregulated following E93 overexpression in Drosophila S2 cells but were decreased after E93 knockdown in the wing. Moreover, the impairment of the Dpp signaling pathway phenocopied the defects of E93 knockdown on wing development.

Ecdysis is a vital process for insects, during which they shed the old cuticle in order to emerge as the following developmental stage. Given its relevance for survival and reproduction, ecdysis is tightly regulated by peptidic hormones that conform an interrelated neuromodulatory network. This network was studied in species that undergo a complete metamorphosis, but not in hemimetabola. In a recent work, we demonstrated that orcokinin neuropeptides are essential for ecdysis to occur in the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus. Here we performed gene silencing, quantitative PCR and in vitro treatments in order to study the interrelationships between RhoprOKs and hormones such as ecdysis triggering hormone, corazonin, eclosion hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide and ecdysone. Our results suggest that RhoprOKs directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other genes. Whereas RhoprOKA is centrally involved in the regulation of gene expression, RhoprOKB is implicated in processes related to midgut physiology. Therefore, we propose that the different transcripts encoded in RhoprOK gene could integrate signaling cues, in order to coordinate the nutritional state with development and ecdysis.

Melanism in insects is important for their physical protection, immunoreactions, and sclerotization. The vetch aphid, Megoura viciae (Buckton), has relatively strong tanning in its prothorax, head, antennae, cornicles, and legs. It was hypothesized that M. viciae may sequester the high level of l-DOPA in its host Vicia faba to help in its melanization process for ecological adaptation. To confirm this hypothesis, the amount of l-DOPA in M. viciae was modified and quantified. We first generated a Trifolium repens (clover, low l-DOPA containing) host to cut off the extra l-DOPA intake by M. viciae. The rate-limiting tyrosine hydroxylase gene of M. viciae (MV-TH) was then cloned and analyzed. To further reduce the l-DOPA level in the insect, RNAi was used to downregulate the transcriptional level of MV-TH. Our results confirmed that M. viciae could indeed sequester l-DOPA in its body, and its ample storage of this amino acid could be the reason for the strong tanning of its body. M. viciae reared on T. repens could upregulate its MV-TH to enhance l-DOPA biosynthesis and thus maintain a high level of l-DOPA. The MV-TH repression by RNAi lasted for about 3  days, successfully decreasing the l-DOPA level. Aside from a slight decrease in exuvia tanning, no other obvious change in body appearance was detected in the RNAi-treated insect. Although M. viciae can obtain most of its l-DOPA directly from its original host, its internal l-DOPA synthetase is still functional, especially when extra l-DOPA is removed from the diet.

Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression. Finally, a double-repressor hypothesis-inspired vg gene knock-down experiment suggests the existence of a positive molecular loop between JH, ftz-f1 and vg.',{'entities': [(37,43,'Gene'),(62,70,'Species'),(71,85,'Species'),(129,135,'Gene'),(141,153,'Gene'),(155,161,'Gene'),(261,267,'Gene'),(394,403,'Species'),(434,446,'Gene'),(448,450,'Gene'),(453,469,'Gene'),(474,499,'Gene'),(704,710,'Gene'),(784,790,'Gene'),(855,864,'Species'),(933,939,'Gene'),(1178,1184,'Gene'),(1259,1261,'Gene'),(1266,1281,'Gene'),(1294,1300,'Gene'),(1361,1363,'Gene'),(1455,1461,'Gene'),(1466,1468,'Gene')]}),('UDP-Glycosyltransferases are involved in imidacloprid resistance in the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Lividae). UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), as phase II detoxification enzymes, are widely distributed within living organisms and play vital roles in the biotransformation of endobiotics and xenobiotics in insects. Insects increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress of xenobiotics, including insecticides. However, the roles of UGTs in insecticide resistance are still seldom reported. In this study, two UGT inhibitors, namely, 5-nitrouracil and sulfinpyrazone, were found to synergistically increase the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population of Diaphorina citri. Based on transcriptome data, a total of 17 putative UGTs were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that fourteen of the 17 UGT genes were overexpressed in the resistant population relative to the susceptible population. Using RNA interference technology to knockdown six UGT genes, the results suggested that silencing the selected UGT375A1, UGT383A1, UGT383B1, and UGT384A1 genes dramatically increased the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. However, silencing the UGT362B1 and UGT379A1 genes did not result in a significant increase in the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population.

Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), a symbiotic virus harbored by the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus, suppresses innate immunity in parasitized Spodoptera litura. Here, we generated eIF4E dsRNA and used it to silence the eIF4E gene of S. litura, resulting in a hallmark immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis of hemocytes and retardation of head capsule width development. In response to natural parasitism, loss of eIF4E function was associated with similar immunosuppression, and we detected no significant differences between the response to parasitism and treatment with eIF4E RNAi. Under MbBV infection, eIF4E overexpression significantly suppressed MbBV-induced increase in apoptosis and suppressed apoptosis to the same extent as co-expression of both eIF4E and eIF4A. There were no significant differences between MbBV-infected and uninfected larvae in which eIF4E was overexpressed. More importantly, in the eIF4E RNAi strain, eIF4A RNAi did not increase apoptosis.

Organisms exhibit a wide range of seasonal responses as adaptions to predictable annual changes in their environment. These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth s cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include floration, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain.

Ommochrome is the major source for eye coloration of all insect species so far examined. Phenoxazinone synthetase (PHS) has always been regarded as the terminal step enzyme for ommochrome formation, which is encoded by cardinal or karmoisin genes. Our previous study indicated that the karmoisin ortholog gene (Nl-karmoisin) product in the brown planthopper (BPH) was a monocarboxylate transporter, while not a PHS. Here, based on full-length complementary DNA, the cardinal ortholog gene in BPH (Nl-cardinal) product was predicted to be a haem peroxidase rather than a PHS. We suggest for the first time that neither karmoisin nor cardinal encodes the PHS, but whether PHS participates in BPH eye pigmentation needs further research. Nymphal RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that knockdown Nl-cardinal transcript led the BPH ocelli and compound eye to color change from brown to red, while knockdown Nl-karmoisin only made the ocelli present the red phenotype. Notably, not only the Nl-cardinal transcript, dscd injection (Nl-cardinal targeting double-stranded DNA (dsRNA)) also significantly reduced the Nl-karmoisin transcript by 33.7%, while dska (Nl-karmoisin targeting dsRNA) injection did not significantly change the Nl-cardinal transcript. Considering the above RNAi and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results, we propose that Nl-cardinal plays a more important role in ommochrome synthesis than Nl-karmoisin, and it may be an upstream gene of Nl-karmoisin.

In target cells of ILPs, insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) is highly conserved in animals. IIS in the legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is known to be involved in maintaining hemolymph trehalose levels and promoting larval growth. However, ILPs in M. vitrata have not been reported yet. This study predicted two ILP genes of Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 from transcriptome of M. vitrata. Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 shared high sequence homologies and domain architecture with Drosophila ILPs. Both ILPs exhibited similar expression patterns in most developmental stages, showing high expression levels in adult stage. In the larval stage, Mv-ILP1 and Mv-IlP2 were expressed mostly in the brain and fat body. However, in the adult stage, both ILP genes were expressed more in the abdomen than those in the head containing the brain.

RESULTS: The inducible expression of CYP6CY19 was the highest among three genes, followed by those of CYP6CY22 and CYP6DA1. The regions from -687 to +586 bp of CYP6DA1, from -666 to +140 bp of CYP6CY19 and from -530 to +218 bp of CYP6CY22 were essential for basal transcriptional activity.

Phenoloxidase (PO) plays a key role in melanin biosynthesis during insect development. Here, we isolated the 2310-bp full-length cDNA of PPO1 from Zeugodacus tau, a destructive horticultural pest. qRT-polymerase chain reaction showed that the ZtPPO1 transcripts were highly expressed during larval-prepupal transition and in the haemolymph. When the larvae were fed a 1.66% kojic acid (KA)-containing diet, the levels of the ZtPPO1 transcripts significantly increased by 2.79- and 3.39-fold in the whole larvae and cuticles, respectively, while the corresponding PO activity was significantly reduced; in addition, the larval and pupal durations were significantly prolonged; pupal weights were lowered; and abnormal phenotypes were observed. An in vitro inhibition experiment indicated that KA was an effective competitive inhibitor of PO in Z. tau. Additionally, the functional analysis showed that 20E could significantly up-regulate the expression of ZtPPO1, induce lower pupal weight, and advance pupation. Knockdown of the ZtPPO1 gene by RNAi significantly decreased mRNA levels after 24 h and led to low pupation rates and incomplete pupae with abnormal phenotypes during the larval-pupal interim period.

In the current study, we address the biological function of a conserved miRNA, Bdo-Let-7 in the regulation of BdE75 gene, which belongs to the ecdysone signaling pathway and participates in the larval-pupal development in B. dorsalis. Using dual luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells we show that Bdo-Let-7 miRNA interacts with the 3  untranslated region of BdE75 gene and suppresses its expression. The Bdo-Let-7 and BdE75 are also co-expressed in the larval-pupal stages and in different tissues of B. dorsalis.

Many organisms have evolved a series of adaptions, such as dormancy or diapause in insects that enable them to withstand seasonally adverse conditions. In insects, photoperiodic signals received during the diapause induction phase have irreversible effect on diapause initiation. Insects continue to be exposed to diapause-inducing photoperiod after the diapause induction phase during diapause preparation before they enter diapause. However, how photoperiodic signals experienced during the diapause preparation phase (DPP) regulate diapause remains largely unclear. In this paper, we investigate this in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi. The cabbage beetle is in many respects an ideal experimental model in which to investigate the effect of photoperiodic signals on the DPP because it has facultative reproductive diapause induced by long-day length and has differentiable diapause induction and preparation phases. We found that the lipid content of female cabbage beetles decreased after diapause-destined (DD) individuals were exposed to a diapause-inhibiting photoperiod during the DPP. Two circadian clock negative regulators, per and tim, were probably involved in the photoperiodic response of beetles during the DPP. Per and tim presented obvious oscillation of circadian rhythm and photoperiodic response during the DPP in DD females and knock-down of these genes in DD females caused their lipid content to decrease. Per and tim probably promote lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of genes that regulate lipogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, decreased lipid accumulation caused by exposure to different photoperiods during the DPP was independent of juvenile hormone. In summary, these results suggest that photoperiodic signals received during the DPP influence lipid accumulation in DD insects. DD insects still have some ability to monitor photoperiodic changes during the DPP and per and tim are probably involved in regulating physiological responses to photoperiodic signals during diapause preparation. These results shed light on the relationship between photoperiodic signals and diapause preparation, and may provide new insights on both how to better utilize insects as resources and for pest management.',{'entities': [(131,145,'Species'),(147,167,'Species'),(780,787,'Species'),(795,815,'Species'),(821,828,'Species'),(1139,1146,'Species'),(1313,1316,'Gene'),(1321,1324,'Gene'),(1406,1409,'Gene'),(1414,1417,'Gene'),(1608,1611,'Gene'),(1616,1619,'Gene'),(2087,2090,'Gene'),(2095,2098,'Gene')]}),('Transcription factors CncC/Maf and AhR/ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GSTs conferring resistance to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in Spodoptera exigua. BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of multifunctional dimeric proteins existing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in the detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles, including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GST genes in insects are poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified at least three GST genes involved in resistance to the insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that three GSTs (SeGSTo2, SeGSTe6 and SeGSTd3) harbor the same cap  n  collar C/muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (CncC/Maf) binding site, and SeGSTo2 and SeGSTe6 contain the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (AhR/ARNT) binding site. Luciferase reporter assay showed co-transfection of reporter plasmid containing the SeGSTe6 promoter with CncC and/or Maf expressing constructs significantly boosted transcription. Similarly, AhR and/or ARNT expressing constructs also significantly increased the promoter activities. The co-transfection of mutated reporter plasmid with CncC/Maf or AhR/ARNT did not increase transcription activity anymore. Constitutive over-expression of CncC, Maf and AhR was also found in the HZ16 strain, which might be the molecular mechanism for up-regulated expression of multiple detoxification genes conferring resistance to insecticides.

In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising method for controlling pest insects by silencing the expression of vital insect genes to interfere with development and physiology; however, certain insect Orders are resistant to this process. In this study, we set out to test the ability of in planta-expressed dsRNA synthesized within the plastids to silence gene expression in an insect recalcitrant to RNAi, the lepidopteran species, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). Using the Manduca vacuolar-type H+ ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) gene as the target, we first evaluated RNAi efficiency of two dsRNA products of different lengths by directly feeding the in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs to M. sexta larvae. We found that a long dsRNA of 2222 bp was the most effective in inducing lethality and silencing the v-ATPaseA gene, when delivered orally in a water droplet. We further transformed the plastid genome of the M. sexta host plant, Nicotiana tabacum, to produce this long dsRNA in its plastids and performed bioassays with M. sexta larvae on the transplastomic plants. In the tested insects, the plastid-derived dsRNA had no effect on larval survival and no statistically significant effect on expression of the v-ATPaseA gene was observed. Comparison of the absolute quantities of the dsRNA present in transplastomic leaf tissue for v-ATPaseA and a control gene, GFP, of a shorter size, revealed a lower concentration for the long dsRNA product compared to the short control product. We suggest that stability and length of the dsRNA may have influenced the quantities produced in the plastids, resulting in inefficient RNAi in the tested insects.

BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests.

Key insect genes are the choice for silencing to achieve pest derived resistance where resistance genes are not available in gene pool of host plant. In this study, an attempt was made to determine the effect of dsRNA designed from two genes Cytochrome P450 derivative (CYP6) and Aminopeptidase N (APN) of rice yellow stem borer (YSB) on growth and development of insect. The bioassays involved injection of chemically synthesized 5  FAM labeled 21-nt dsRNA into rice cut stems and allowing the larvae to feed on these stems which resulted in increased mortality and observed growth and development changes in larval length and weight compared with its untreated control at 12-15 days after treatment. These results were further supported by observing the reduction in transcripts expression of these genes in treated larvae. Fluorescence detection in treated larvae also proved that dsRNA was readily taken by larvae when fed on dsRNA treated stems. These results from the present study clearly show that YSB larvae fed on dsRNA designed from Cytochrome P450 and Aminopeptidase N has detrimental effect on larval growth and development.

UNASSIGNED: Lysozymes are enzymes that destroy bacterial cell walls by hydrolysing the polysaccharide component of peptidoglycan. In insects, there are two classes of lysozymes, the c-type with muramidase activity and the i-type whose prototypical members from annelids and molluscs possess both muramidase and isopeptidase activities. Many insect genes encoding c-type and i-type lysozymes have been identified during genome and transcriptome analyses, but only c-type lysozymes have been functionally characterized at the protein level. Here we produced one of five i-type lysozymes represented in the immunity-related transcriptome of the invasive harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis as recombinant protein. This was the only one containing the serine and histidine residues that are thought to be required for isopeptidase activity. This i-type lysozyme was recombinantly expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, but the purified protein was inactive in both muramidase and isopeptidase assays. Transcription and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that this i-type lysozyme is produced in the fat body but is not inducible by immune challenge.

Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been is currently developed for protection against insect pests. In this study, we used this technology to silence the arginine kinase (AK) gene of Helicoverpa armigera (HaAK), encoding a phosphotransferase that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism in invertebrate. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants producing HaAK dsRNA were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The maximal mortality rate of 55% was reached when H. armigera first-instar larvae were fed with transgenic plant leaves for 3 days, which was dramatically higher than the 18% mortality recorded in the control group. Moreover, the ingestion of transgenic plants significantly retarded larval growth, and the transcript levels of HaAK were also knocked down by up to 52%. The feeding bioassays further indicated that the inhibition efficiency was correlated with the integrity and concentration of the produced HaAK dsRNA in transgenic plants.

We have previously identified 189 novel intermediate-size ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori, including 40 ncRNAs that showed altered expression in different developmental stages. Here we characterized the functions of these 40 ncRNAs by measuring their expressions in six tissues of the fifth instar larvae using Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. We identified nine ncRNAs (four small nucleolar RNAs and five unclassified ncRNAs) that were enriched in silk gland, including four ncRNAs that showed silk gland-specific expression. We further showed that three of nine silk gland-enriched ncRNAs were predominantly expressed in the anterior silk gland, whereas another three ncRNAs were highly accumulated in the posterior silk gland, suggesting that they may play different roles in fibroin synthesis. Furthermore, an unclassified ncRNA, Bm-152, exhibited converse expression pattern with its antisense host gene gartenzwerg in diverse tissues, and might regulate the expression of gartenzwerg through RNA-protein complex. In addition, two silk gland-enriched ncRNAs Bm-102 and Bm-159 can be found in histone modification complex, which indicated that they might play roles through epigenetic modifications.

In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable.

P. glaucus contains two nearly identical genes, CYP6B4v2 and CYP6B5v1, and P. polyxenes contains two related genes, CYP6B1v3 and CYP6B3v2.

Comparisons of the organizational structures of these genes indicate that all have the same intron/exon arrangement.

The centriole is the core structure of centrosome and cilium. Failure to restrict centriole duplication to once per cell cycle has serious consequences and is commonly observed in cancer. Despite its medical importance, the mechanism of centriole formation is poorly understood. Asl was previously reported to be a centrosomal protein essential for centrosome function. Here we identify mecD, a severe loss-of-function allele of the asl gene, and demonstrate that it is required for centriole and cilia formation. Similarly, Cep152, the Asl ortholog in vertebrates, is essential for cilia formation and its function can be partially rescued by the Drosophila Asl. The study of Asl localization suggests that it is closely associated with the centriole wall, but is not part of the centriole structure. By analyzing the biogenesis of centrosomes in cells depleted of Asl, we found that, while pericentriolar material (PCM) function is mildly affected, Asl is essential for daughter centriole formation.

We first improved the mapping resolution in the 73A-84AB region using 12 introgression lines and 62 recombinant nearly isogenic lines. To further narrow the list of candidate genes, we assayed leg-specific expression and identified genes with transcript-level evolution consistent with a potential role in sex-comb divergence. Sex combs are formed on the prothoracic (front) legs, but not on the mesothoracic (middle) legs of Drosophila males. We extracted RNA from the prothoracic and mesothoracic pupal legs of two species to determine which of the genes expressed differently between leg types were also divergent for gene expression. Two good functional candidate genes, Scr and dsx, are located in one of our fine-scale QTL regions. In addition, three previously uncharacterized genes (CG15186, CG2016, and CG2791) emerged as new candidates. These genes are located in regions strongly associated with sex-comb tooth number differences and are expressed differently between leg tissues and between species.

Bombyx BRF contains the following domains that have been noted in all other BRFs, and that are likely, therefore, to provide highly conserved functions: a zinc finger domain, an imperfect repeat, three "BRF Homology" domains, and an acidic domain at the C-terminus. As expected from the evolutionary relationships among insects and mammals, Bombyx BRF is more similar overall to Drosophila BRF (55% identical) than to human BRF1 (42% identical). Detailed examination of individual domains reveals a remarkable exception, however. Domain II of Bombyx BRF is more similar to its human counterpart than to Drosophila Domain II.

The proximal 5  end flanking sequence from the transcription initiation site is highly conserved (91-98% nt identity).

These Hsps showed high homology to their counterparts in other species. A phylogenetic analysis of the Hsp90 sequence was consistent with the known classification of insects. Northern blot hybridization indicated the presence of hsp90 transcripts in all tissues, but expression in the brain-subesophageal complex was especially pronounced. The genomic organization of hsp90 examined by Southern blot suggested the presence of a single copy of hsp90 in the H. zea genome. The expression patterns after heat shock indicated that hsp70 and hsp90 were heat-inducible, although hsp70 was more strongly induced than hsp90, and hsc70 was indeed a constitutively expressed member of the hsp70 family. Expression of hsp70 and hsc70 were not altered by the diapause program, but hsp90 was down-regulated at this time. Low temperatures (0-4 degrees C) and recovery from low temperature elicited hsp70 and hsp90 responses, but not an hsc70 response.

During early choriogenesis, BmCAP-A has a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm but could also be found concentrated at the apical and basal sides at the cell-cell junctions. During late choriogenesis, the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of BmCAP-A disappears while the staining pattern at the apical side resembles a blueprint for the eggshell surface structure.

SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses of the digestive system in the higher termite Nasutitermes takasagoensis revealed that beta-glucosidase activity is localized in the salivary glands and midgut as dimeric glycoproteins. Degenerate PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the salivary beta-glucosidase resulted in cDNA fragments of 1.7 kb, encoding 489 amino acids with a sequence similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. Moreover, these primers amplified cDNA fragments from the midgut, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87-91% identical to those of the salivary beta-glucosidases. Successful expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli implies that these sequences also encode functional beta-glucosidases.

Paralogous-specific depletion of Bgace transcripts was evident in ganglia of injected cockroaches, although the effects at the protein level were less pronounced.

In metazoans, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) direct a myriad of developmental and adult homeostatic events through their heterotetrameric type I and type II receptor complexes. We examined 3 existing and 12 newly generated mutations in the Drosophila type I receptor gene, saxophone (sax), the ortholog of the human Activin Receptor-Like Kinase1 and -2 (ALK1/ACVRL1 and ALK2/ACVR1) genes. Our genetic analyses identified two distinct classes of sax alleles. The first class consists of homozygous viable gain-of-function (GOF) alleles that exhibit (1) synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in BMP pathway components, and (2) significant maternal effect lethality that can be rescued by an increased dosage of the BMP encoding gene, dpp+. In contrast, the second class consists of alleles that are recessive lethal and do not exhibit lethality in combination with mutations in other BMP pathway components. The alleles in this second class are clearly loss-of-function (LOF) with both complete and partial loss-of-function mutations represented. We find that one allele in the second class of recessive lethals exhibits dominant-negative behavior, albeit distinct from the GOF activity of the first class of viable alleles. On the basis of the fact that the first class of viable alleles can be reverted to lethality and on our ability to independently generate recessive lethal sax mutations, our analysis demonstrates that sax is an essential gene. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that a normal sax transcript is produced by saxP, a viable allele previously reported to be null, and that this allele can be reverted to lethality. Interestingly, we determine that two mutations in the first class of sax alleles show the same amino acid substitutions as mutations in the human receptors ALK1/ACVRl-1 and ACVR1/ALK2, responsible for cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), respectively.

Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) nuneztovari Gabald n (Diptera: Culicidae), a locally important malaria vector in some regions of South America, has been hypothesized to consist of at least two cryptic incipient species. We investigated its phylogeographic structure in several South American localities to determine the number of lineages and levels of divergence using the nuclear white gene, a marker that detected two recently diverged genotypes in the primary Neotropical malaria vector Anopheles darlingi Root. In An. nuneztovari, five distinct lineages (1-5) were elucidated: (1) populations from northeastern and central Amazonia; (2) populations from Venezuela east and west of the Andes; (3) populations from Colombia and Venezuela west of the Andes; (4) southeastern and western Amazonian Brazil populations, and (5) southeastern and western Amazonian Brazil and Bolivian populations. There was a large amount of genetic differentiation among these lineages. The deepest and earliest divergence was found between lineage 3 and lineages 1, 2 and 4, which probably accounts for the detection of lineage 3 in some earlier studies. The multiple lineages within Amazonia are partially congruent with previous mtDNA and ITS2 data, but were undetected in many earlier studies, probably because of their recent (Pleistocene) divergence and the differential mutation rates of the markers. The estimates for the five lineages, interpreted as recently evolved or incipient species, date to the Pleistocene and Pliocene. We hypothesize that the diversification in An. nuneztovari is the result of an interaction between the Miocene/Pliocene marine incursion and Pleistocene climatic changes leading to refugial isolation. The identification of cryptic lineages in An. nuneztovari could have a significant impact on local vector control measures.',{'entities': [(38,43,'Gene'),(104,125,'Species'),(520,525,'Gene'),(629,647,'Species'),(657,672,'Species'),(1700,1715,'Species'),(1900,1915,'Species')]}),('Isolation and expression analysis of a homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon gene in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. A full-length 14-3-3 gene homolog (also referred to as the Px14-3-3 epsilon " " or Px14-3-3  gene) was cloned from cDNA of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Px14-3-3 transcript is 789 nucleotides in length, and the predicted polypeptide is 263 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6  kDa. The Px14-3-3 gene contains the typical and predicted 14-3-3 domains and motifs. The amino acid sequence of the diamondback moth 14-3-3 gene is very similar to that of other insect epsilons ( ) but not to other insect zetas ( ). In particular, the protein sequence of the Px14-3-3 gene shows high identity to the Bombyx mori epsilon (96.2%). Western blot analysis using an antibody against Px14-3-3  verified the expression of 14-3-3  in the larval, pupal, and adult stages. The Px14-3-3  expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth instar larvae.

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles in apoptosis and other key cellular processes. A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity.

This study examines the responses of heat shock protein transcripts, Hsp70 and Hsp90, to dehydration stress in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens. We first defined the water balance attributes of adult females of each species, monitored expression of the hsp transcripts in response to dehydration, and then knocked down expression of the transcripts using RNA interference (RNAi) to evaluate potential functions of the Hsps in maintenance of water balance. Fully hydrated females of all three species contained nearly the same amount of water (66-68%), but water loss rates differed among the species, with A. aegypti having the lowest water loss rate (2.6%/h), followed by C. pipiens (3.3%/h), and A. gambiae (5.1%/h). In all three species water could be replaced only by drinking water (or blood). Both A. aegypti and C. pipiens tolerated a loss of 36% of their body water, but A. gambiae was more vulnerable to water loss, tolerating a loss of only 29% of its body water. Dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in all three species, but only C. pipiens continued to express this transcript during rehydration. Hsp90 was constitutively expressed and expression levels remained fairly constant during dehydration and rehydration, except expression was not noted during rehydration of C. pipiens. Injection of dsRNA to knock down expression of hsp70 (83% reduction) and hsp90 (46% reduction) in A. aegypti did not alter water content or water loss rates, but the dehydration tolerance was lower. Instead of surviving a 36% water loss, females were able to survive only a 28% water loss in response to RNAi directed against hsp70 and a 26% water loss when RNAi was directed against hsp90. These results indicate a critical function for these Hsps in mosquito dehydration tolerance.',{'entities': [(103,121,'Gene'),(135,140,'Gene'),(145,150,'Gene'),(201,214,'Species'),(216,233,'Species'),(238,251,'Species'),(781,791,'Species'),(927,937,'Species'),(1117,1122,'Gene'),(1154,1164,'Species'),(1222,1227,'Gene'),(1394,1404,'Species'),(1453,1458,'Gene'),(1479,1484,'Gene'),(1732,1737,'Gene'),(1790,1795,'Gene')]})]
